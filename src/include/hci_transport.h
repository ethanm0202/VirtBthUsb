/*
 * hci_transport.h - transport seam between the Windows-facing USB front end and the HCI backend.
 *
 * DeckBtUsb presents a virtual USB Bluetooth radio to Windows. The driver supports either
 * the synthetic stub backend (Backend=0) or the physical QCA2066 UART backend (Backend=1),
 * selected by the `Backend` registry value read at PrepareHardware.
 *
 * The USB front end (src/driver/endpoints.c) moves packets between USB endpoints and this
 * interface without backend-specific knowledge.
 *
 * Layering rules:
 *   - Submit* / Has / Pop / LastEventLength are called with the controller spin lock held, at
 *     <= DISPATCH_LEVEL. They must not block, allocate, or touch paged memory.
 *   - Notify is called with no lock held that any Submit/Has/Pop/LastEventLength/Reset path
 *     acquires. It allows an asynchronous backend to wake the front end when a stream becomes
 *     readable. The stub completes synchronously inside SubmitCommand; the UART backend calls
 *     Notify from its read-completion path after releasing its internal lock. Calling Notify
 *     from inside the backend's receive lock would create an AB-BA lock inversion with Pop at
 *     DISPATCH_LEVEL.
 *   - Reset is called with the controller lock held. It leaves every stream empty and discards
 *     any partially received packet.
 *
 * Framing:
 * Buffers crossing this interface carry no H4 packet-type prefix. USB separates streams with
 * endpoints, so an event buffer starts at the event code and an ACL buffer starts at the handle.
 * The H4 prefix is a UART-transport detail handled within the UART backend.
 *
 * Compiles in kernel mode (the driver) and user mode (host-side test suites) with no
 * NTSTATUS, WDF types, or dynamic memory allocation.
