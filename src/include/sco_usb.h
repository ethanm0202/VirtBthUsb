/*
 * sco_usb.h - SCO voice between the radio's USB isochronous endpoints and HCI SCO packets.
 *
 * BTHUSB moves synchronous voice (SCO/eSCO, Hands-Free) over the SCO interface's isochronous
 * endpoints 0x03 (OUT) and 0x83 (IN), one packet per 1 ms frame at the selected alternate setting's
 * wMaxPacketSize (9/17/25/33/49/63 bytes, src/include/usb_descriptors.h). The UART carries complete
 * HCI SCO packets ([handle+flags LE16][length u8][payload], no H4 byte at this seam). This module
 * converts between the two and supplies the time base BTHUSB would otherwise get from a real bus.
 *
 * Pacing (ScoUsbSchedule, ScoUsbOutPacketSpan):
 * SCO has no host-side flow control, and BTHUSB measures audio pacing solely by the rate
 * at which isochronous transfers complete. Completing transfers immediately would cause
 * BTHUSB to transmit ahead of real time, leading to buffer overflow and dropped audio.
 * The virtual bus completes each transfer only after the air time represented by the
 * transfer has elapsed relative to the previous transfer on that endpoint.
 *
 * For alternate settings 1-5 (CVSD / linear PCM), each isochronous packet corresponds
 * to a 1 ms frame (e.g. alt setting 2: 16 bytes/ms = 8 kHz 16-bit voice).
 * For alternate setting 6 (63-byte packets, mSBC), each non-empty packet carries one
 * complete 60-byte mSBC frame representing 7.5 ms of audio. Pacing these transfers at
 * 1 ms would deliver frames at over six times the link's transmission rate (133.3 frames/sec),
 * causing buffer exhaustion and audio loss. Non-empty packets on alternate setting 6 are
 * therefore paced at 7.5 ms intervals (SCO_USB_MSBC_FRAME_100NS).
 *
 * Host -> Controller (SCO_USB_OUT):
 * Each OUT isochronous packet's bytes are queued with the time of the frame that carries them and
 * released at that time, so the controller receives voice at the air rate instead of in bursts the
 * size of an URB. Released bytes are a stream: HCI SCO packets are reassembled from their 3-byte
 * header however they were cut into isochronous packets. The ring drops its oldest frame when full
 * (bounded latency); after a drop, reassembly restarts only at a frame whose first bytes carry the
 * connection handle last seen, so a lost header cannot desynchronise the stream for good.
 *
 * Controller -> Host (SCO_USB_IN):
 * The controller chooses its own SCO packet size over the UART (up to 240 bytes). A USB
 * radio instead emits the geometry of the selected setting (Core Vol 4 Part B 2.1.1): for alternate
 * settings 1-5 one HCI SCO packet of 3 * wMaxPacketSize - 3 payload bytes spans exactly three
 * isochronous packets (alt 2: 3 + 48 = 51 = 3 x 17); at wMaxPacketSize 63 (alt 6, mSBC) one packet of
 * 60 payload bytes fills one isochronous packet. The IN framer re-cuts the controller's payload
 * stream into that geometry, keeping the controller's handle and packet-status flags, so BTHUSB
 * sees what a USB controller would send whether it parses by header or by packet boundary. A frame
 * with no complete packet to send carries zero bytes: gaps are lost, never invented. The framer pulls
 * a controller packet only when it lacks one packet's payload, so at most two controller packets wait
 * here; staleness beyond that is bounded by the bridge's overwrite-oldest SCO FIFO.
