/*
 * sco_route.h - put BTHPORT's synchronous (voice) links on the HCI data path.
 *
 * BTHPORT sets up voice using legacy Setup/Accept_Synchronous_Connection commands (0x0428/0x0429),
 * which carry no data-path field. On QCA2066, the controller defaults to offloaded audio
 * rather than HCI. The Enhanced synchronous commands (0x043D/0x043E) specify Input/Output_Data_Path;
 * data path 0x00 selects HCI (compare upstream Linux hci_conn.c hci_enhanced_setup_sync:
 * https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/net/bluetooth/hci_conn.c?id=a5218c6474df97f2e7f3af15dcdfc674bae5c137).
 *
 * This module rewrites legacy setup/accept commands to Enhanced equivalents specifying data path
 * 0x00 (HCI), preserving BTHPORT's bandwidths, latency, packet types, and retransmission effort,
 * and deriving codec fields from Voice_Setting (transparent = mSBC frames, CVSD = 16-bit linear PCM
 * on the host side). When the controller replies with Command Status or Command Complete for the
 * Enhanced opcode, the legacy opcode is restored for BTHPORT. Air codings other than CVSD and
 * transparent (u-law, A-law) pass through unchanged.
